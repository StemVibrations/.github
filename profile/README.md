# STEM VIBRATIONS

Repository for the STEM VIBRATIONS project.

## Project Description

STEM (SpoorTrillingenEmissieModel) is an open-source calculation model that is developed to compute the impact of mitigation techniques on railway induced vibrations.

The project documentation can be found [here](https://stemvibrations.readthedocs.io/).

## Repositories

### [STEM](https://github.com/StemVibrations/STEM)

STEM is the main repository for the STEM project. It contains the source code of the STEM calculation model.

### [vehicle_models](https://github.com/StemVibrations/vehicle_models)

UVEC (User defined VEhiCle models) is a vehicle model that is used in the STEM calculation model. It is a generic model that can be used to model any type of vehicle.

### [RandomFields](https://github.com/StemVibrations/RandomFields)

Generation of unstructured Random Fields based on [GS Tools](https://geostat-framework.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

### [gmsh_utils](https://github.com/StemVibrations/gmsh_utils)

Mesh generation utilities to generate meshes for the STEM calculation model. It is based on [Gmsh](http://gmsh.info/).

### [STEMKratos](https://github.com/StemVibrations/StemKratos)

[KRATOS](https://github.com/KratosMultiphysics/Kratos) libraries for the STEM calculation model.

### [Issues](https://github.com/StemVibrations/Issues)

Public issue tracker for the STEM project.
